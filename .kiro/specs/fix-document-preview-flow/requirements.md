# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DocGen application currently has several critical issues preventing the document upload and preview flow from working correctly. Users cannot properly navigate from document upload to preview, and export functionality is broken. This feature aims to fix these core workflow issues to restore the basic document management functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload a document and immediately see it in the preview page, so that I can start editing and working with my document.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a document from the dashboard THEN the system SHALL navigate to the preview page with the correct document ID
2. WHEN the preview page loads with a valid document ID THEN the system SHALL display the document metadata and empty editor
3. IF the document ID is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message and redirect to dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my edited documents as PDF or DOCX files, so that I can download and use them outside the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the PDF export button THEN the system SHALL generate a PDF file and provide a download link
2. WHEN a user clicks the DOCX export button THEN the system SHALL generate a DOCX file and provide a download link
3. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message to the user
4. WHEN export succeeds THEN the system SHALL open the file in a new tab or trigger download

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent API communication across the frontend, so that all requests use the same base URL and authentication patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any frontend component makes an API request THEN it SHALL use the same fetchWithAuth utility
2. WHEN the fetchWithAuth utility is used THEN it SHALL include the correct API base URL
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL include the JWT token in all requests
