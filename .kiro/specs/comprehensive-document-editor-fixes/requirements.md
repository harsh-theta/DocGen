# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DocGen application has several critical issues affecting the document editing and export experience. The Tiptap editor has layout and parsing problems, export formats (PDF/DOCX) produce inconsistent results, table parsing fails, content generation copies reference data inappropriately, HTML parsing creates too many sections, and the output formatting has aesthetic issues. This comprehensive fix aims to resolve all these issues to provide a professional document editing and export experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Tiptap editor to use the full available screen space, so that I can see my document content properly formatted without cramped text display.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the preview page loads THEN the Tiptap editor SHALL occupy at least 80% of the available viewport width
2. WHEN the editor is displayed THEN the text SHALL have proper line spacing and readability
3. WHEN the viewport is resized THEN the editor SHALL maintain responsive width proportions
4. WHEN content is typed in the editor THEN it SHALL display with proper formatting and spacing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Tiptap editor to properly parse and display tables and complex components, so that I can work with rich document content without formatting issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document contains tables THEN the Tiptap editor SHALL render them with proper borders, spacing, and cell alignment
2. WHEN tables have multiple rows and columns THEN the editor SHALL maintain table structure and allow editing
3. WHEN complex HTML components are present THEN the editor SHALL parse and display them correctly
4. WHEN users edit table content THEN the changes SHALL be preserved and displayed properly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want PDF and DOCX exports to produce consistent layouts and formatting, so that my documents look professional regardless of export format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is exported as PDF and DOCX THEN both formats SHALL have identical text formatting, spacing, and layout
2. WHEN tables are present in the document THEN both PDF and DOCX exports SHALL render tables with consistent styling
3. WHEN headings are used THEN both formats SHALL apply the same heading styles and hierarchy
4. WHEN lists are present THEN both formats SHALL use consistent bullet points and indentation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want DOCX export to properly parse and include tables, so that my table data is preserved in Word documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document contains tables THEN the DOCX export SHALL include all table content with proper structure
2. WHEN tables have headers THEN the DOCX export SHALL format them as table headers
3. WHEN table cells contain formatted text THEN the DOCX export SHALL preserve the formatting
4. WHEN tables span multiple pages THEN the DOCX export SHALL handle page breaks appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI content generator to create project-specific timelines and hours, so that generated documents reflect my actual project requirements rather than copying reference data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI generates content with tables containing hours or timelines THEN it SHALL calculate values based on the current project context
2. WHEN reference documents contain specific timeline data THEN the AI SHALL use it as a template structure but generate appropriate values for the new project
3. WHEN project tasks are analyzed THEN the AI SHALL estimate realistic hours based on task complexity and scope
4. WHEN multiple similar projects are processed THEN each SHALL receive customized timeline and hour estimates

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved HTML parsing that creates logical document sections, so that the generated content has better structure and readability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTML input is parsed THEN the system SHALL group related content into meaningful sections
2. WHEN parsing creates sections THEN each section SHALL have a clear purpose and logical boundaries
3. WHEN content is divided THEN the system SHALL avoid creating excessive micro-sections that fragment the document
4. WHEN sections are created THEN they SHALL maintain the original content hierarchy and relationships

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want clean document output without redundant titles, so that my documents have professional appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is generated THEN the first page SHALL either be a full cover page or have no title duplication
2. WHEN titles appear on the first page THEN there SHALL be only one title instance
3. WHEN a cover page is used THEN it SHALL utilize the full first page with proper spacing and design
4. WHEN no cover page is used THEN the document SHALL start directly with content without redundant headers

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want PDF exports to use WeasyPrint library with Inter font, so that I get high-quality PDF output with consistent typography.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PDF export is triggered THEN the system SHALL use WeasyPrint library instead of pdfplumber
2. WHEN PDFs are generated THEN they SHALL use Inter font as the default typeface
3. WHEN WeasyPrint processes the document THEN it SHALL maintain all formatting and styling from the HTML
4. WHEN fonts are rendered THEN they SHALL be crisp and professional-looking in the final PDF output
