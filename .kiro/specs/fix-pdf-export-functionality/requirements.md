# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PDF export functionality in the DocGen application is currently broken. When users click the "Export as PDF" button, instead of generating a proper PDF file, the system creates an HTML file and opens it in a new browser tab, displaying raw HTML code. This creates a poor user experience and prevents users from getting the PDF documents they expect.

The system needs to be fixed to generate actual PDF files that can be downloaded or viewed properly in the browser.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my document as a PDF file, so that I can download and share a properly formatted PDF document.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Export as PDF" button THEN the system SHALL generate a proper PDF file from the document content
2. WHEN the PDF generation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a downloadable PDF file or open it in a new tab as a viewable PDF
3. WHEN the PDF is generated THEN the system SHALL preserve the document formatting including headings, paragraphs, and basic styling
4. WHEN the PDF export fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the PDF export to handle HTML content properly, so that my formatted document content appears correctly in the PDF.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the document contains HTML formatting THEN the PDF SHALL convert HTML elements to appropriate PDF formatting
2. WHEN the document contains headings (h1, h2, h3) THEN the PDF SHALL display them as properly styled headings
3. WHEN the document contains paragraphs THEN the PDF SHALL maintain proper paragraph spacing
4. WHEN the document contains lists THEN the PDF SHALL format them as bulleted or numbered lists appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the PDF export to work reliably across different browsers, so that I can export documents regardless of my browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user exports a PDF from Chrome THEN the system SHALL generate a valid PDF file
2. WHEN a user exports a PDF from Firefox THEN the system SHALL generate a valid PDF file  
3. WHEN a user exports a PDF from Safari THEN the system SHALL generate a valid PDF file
4. WHEN the PDF generation encounters browser-specific issues THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during the PDF export process, so that I know the system is working and when the export is complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the PDF export button THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
2. WHEN the PDF generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL display "Exporting..." text on the button
3. WHEN the PDF export completes successfully THEN the system SHALL show a success message
4. WHEN the PDF export fails THEN the system SHALL show a specific error message explaining what went wrong

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the exported PDF to have a meaningful filename, so that I can easily identify the document when it's downloaded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF is exported THEN the filename SHALL include the document title
2. WHEN the document title contains special characters THEN the filename SHALL sanitize them appropriately
3. WHEN the document has no title THEN the filename SHALL use a default naming pattern with timestamp
4. WHEN multiple PDFs are exported from the same document THEN each SHALL have a unique filename
