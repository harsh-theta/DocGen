# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LangGraph Document Generator is an AI-powered system that automates the generation of structured documents by preserving the format of a reference document while regenerating all content based on new project context. The system uses a section-by-section approach with LangGraph orchestration and Gemini LLM to ensure accurate, modular, and scalable document generation for product managers and other professionals who create similar documents repeatedly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to upload a reference document template and provide new project context so that the system can generate a new document with the same structure but updated content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides an HTML template and project context THEN the system SHALL parse the HTML into distinct sections
2. WHEN the HTML template is parsed THEN the system SHALL identify semantic sections (headings, tables, lists, paragraphs) that can be independently processed
3. WHEN sections are identified THEN the system SHALL maintain the original HTML structure and styling information
4. IF the HTML template contains invalid or malformed markup THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to provide project context through multiple input methods so that I can specify my requirements in the most convenient way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides input THEN the system SHALL accept natural language prompts (free-form text)
2. WHEN a user provides input THEN the system SHALL accept structured variables (project_name, project_description)
3. WHEN a user provides input THEN the system SHALL optionally accept JSON overrides for advanced customization
4. WHEN JSON overrides are provided inline in the prompt THEN the system SHALL extract and parse them correctly
5. IF invalid JSON is provided THEN the system SHALL return clear validation errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the document generation to process sections independently so that the system is resilient, modular, and can handle failures gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN document generation begins THEN the system SHALL process each section independently using separate LLM calls
2. WHEN a section fails to generate THEN the system SHALL continue processing other sections without stopping the entire workflow
3. WHEN a section generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback content or retry mechanisms
4. WHEN all sections are processed THEN the system SHALL reassemble them into a complete HTML document
5. IF section reassembly fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information about which sections failed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the LangGraph workflow to be modular and extensible so that I can easily add new features, validation, or processing steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow is designed THEN the system SHALL implement distinct nodes for parsing, generation, and assembly
2. WHEN new functionality is needed THEN the system SHALL allow easy insertion of additional nodes (validation, review, etc.)
3. WHEN the workflow executes THEN each node SHALL have clear inputs, outputs, and error handling
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide logging and state tracking for each node
5. IF a node fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error context and allow for node-level retry

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the generated content to maintain the original document structure while being contextually relevant to my new project so that the output is immediately usable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is generated for each section THEN the system SHALL preserve the original HTML structure and tags
2. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL incorporate the provided project context and variables
3. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL maintain semantic consistency within each section
4. WHEN the final document is assembled THEN the system SHALL ensure proper HTML validity
5. IF generated content doesn't fit the original structure THEN the system SHALL adapt the content while preserving the format

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the LangGraph agent to integrate seamlessly with the existing DocGen system so that it works with the current HTML-centric workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent receives input THEN the system SHALL accept HTML templates from the existing parsing system
2. WHEN the agent generates output THEN the system SHALL return valid HTML compatible with the Tiptap editor
3. WHEN the agent is called THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing database schema (html_template, ai_content fields)
4. WHEN the agent completes THEN the system SHALL provide output that can be exported to DOCX/PDF using existing export functionality
5. IF integration points fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle various document types and complexities so that I can use it for different kinds of professional documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL handle common HTML elements (headings, paragraphs, tables, lists)
2. WHEN processing complex sections THEN the system SHALL maintain table structures, list formatting, and nested elements
3. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL adapt to different document types (technical specs, project plans, reports)
4. WHEN encountering unsupported elements THEN the system SHALL preserve them unchanged or provide appropriate warnings
5. IF document complexity exceeds system capabilities THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about limitations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring so that I can maintain and improve the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with context
2. WHEN the workflow executes THEN the system SHALL log key events and state transitions
3. WHEN LLM calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle API failures, rate limits, and timeouts gracefully
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide workflow state inspection capabilities
5. IF system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide metrics and monitoring data for analysis
