# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DocGen application is experiencing Supabase storage permission issues that prevent file uploads and exports from working. The system is currently using the anon key instead of the service role key, which cannot bypass Row Level Security (RLS) policies. This feature aims to fix the Supabase configuration and storage permissions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to use proper Supabase service credentials, so that file operations can bypass RLS policies when necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend makes storage operations THEN it SHALL use the service role key instead of anon key
2. WHEN using the service role key THEN the system SHALL be able to bypass RLS policies for administrative operations
3. IF the service role key is not available THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload documents successfully, so that I can use the document generation features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a document THEN the system SHALL store it in Supabase storage successfully
2. WHEN upload succeeds THEN the system SHALL return a valid document ID and metadata
3. IF upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about the failure cause

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export documents successfully, so that I can download my generated content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user exports a document THEN the system SHALL create the export file in Supabase storage
2. WHEN export succeeds THEN the system SHALL return a valid download URL
3. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about the failure cause
